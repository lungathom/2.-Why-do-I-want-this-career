# 2.-Why-do-I-want-this-career

Straight from high school, my first choice of career was IT. Lucky me, Capitec took a chance on me as a service consultnat. As i'm working for the bank, my peers started to lean on me with branch IT, then my spark and passion for IT came back. I saw the opportunity of being the *back end developor* in 2020 then i upskilled my self and that's where my attraction, inspiration led me to this decision today
